<p>Just discovered this today.</p>

<p>Enter a command in OSX terminal with an argument, a good example to try is:<br /></p>

<pre><code>  mkdir foo</code></pre>

<p>then press <code>option - .</code> (option-period).</p>

<p>That will insert in the word &#8216;foo&#8217;, or the argument of the last command you just typed in. You&#8217;ll have to make sure you have the &#8216;use option as meta key&#8217; box checked in terminal settings. If you dont want to do that, you can also use Esc as a meta key.</p>

<p>This is especially useful if, like me, you want to execute a number of different commands with the same arguments but are pissed off at continually holding down the left arrow key or some other kind of keyboard gymnastics.</p>
